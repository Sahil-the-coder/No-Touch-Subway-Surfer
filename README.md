# No-Touch-Subway-Surfer
This project is about playing subway surfer with hand gestures.
I had used python and machine learning in this project .
I had attached a zip file which contains all needed files that are important to run this project .
You get an main.py file run that file on vs code it switch in your camera and start detecting your hand movement.
Now open the game and play with cool feature.
